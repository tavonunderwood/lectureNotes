HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?

    p or q or r: top level is the rightmost or //(p or q) or r
    How to build conclusion?
    Try OrE on premise
    SubProof: assume p or q
        goal: r or q or p
        top-level is the rightmost Or 
        Could intorduce OR if have r or q
            of if I had p
        nested OrE 
        SubProof: assume p
            goal: r or q or p
        SubProof: assume q
            goal: r or q or p
            first get r or q 
            then get r or q or p
    SubProof: assume r
        goal: r or q or p

Reminder: implies-elimination, ImplyE

Logika features/tips

- see proof step summary
- renumber/reformat proofs
- interpreting errors


/////////////////////////

General proof strategy to this point
1) list premises 
2) break down any premises you can to get extra information 

3) look at the conclusion 

4) consider if you will need OrE (probably will if you have an OR)

Always consider or order of operations !

How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1:
     for every possible truth assignment, the two statements have the same output

    Approach 2:
        deduction with two proofs
        statement1 |- statement 2
        statement 2 |- statement 1



How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?
    find one truth assignment where the two statements have different outputs
    can't use deduction to prove no inequivalent


What is satisfiability? 
    need ONE truth assignment where the statements outputs true
    (if we did a truth table, would be a tautology or contingent)
To show NOT satistiable

    need FULL truth table to show the statment always outputs false
    ( .e., is contradictory)

        premises, conclusion

    valid: 
        if for every truth assignment where all premises are true,
        the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid:
     1) truth tabel with all premises and conclusion
     look at truth assignments that make all premises true, make sure the conclusion is true
     2) deduction

    how prove invalid?
        find ONE truth assignment where all premises true but conclusion false

        can't prove 


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)
    valid: 

    how prove valid?

    how prove invalid?


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
