Homework 1 due tonight
    last problem:

        You know the thief was either Agatha, Ferdinand, or Carl.
            (some statements)
        You later learn that Carl and Ferdinand were not both telling the truth.
            NOT possible: Carl telling truth, Ferdinand telling truth
            ANYTHING ELSE is possible


    What are the possible cases? 3 cases. Each could be the thief.


    How to check if a possible case works?


I'll post Homework 2 after class (due Tues Feb 3)

Today:

- review implies operator
- evaluating logical statements
- compound truth tables
- using Logika
- parse trees
- begin propositional logic

//////////////////////////////////////////


Review: IMPLIES operator →

"If it is snowing, then I will bring a coat"

p: It is snowing
q: I will bring a coat

p → q

When is this true? When is this false?


p q  #  p → q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    F
F T  #    T
F F  #    T

//////////////////////////////////////

Consider ¬p ∨ q → p ∧ ¬q

--> what operation do we do first?

¬ (highest precedence)
∧
∨
→ (lowest precedence)


Add () to show the order of operations.


((¬p) ∨ q) → (p ∧ (¬q))


Evaluate the above statement using these
variable assignments:

p is T
q is F


((¬T) ∨ F) → (T ∧ (¬F))
((F) ∨ F) → (T ∧ (T))
(F) → (T)
T (output)



4 - 2 - 5
left to right
(4-2) - 5


////////////////////////////////////////////////

Order of operations
    ¬ evaluates right to left

    ∧ and ∨ evaluate left to right

//////////////////////////////////////////

Top-level operator (what happens LAST?)
has the LOWEST precedence



¬p ∨ q ∧ r


<<<<<<< HEAD
top-level? V
Has the lowest precedence


How is this similar to a circuit? THe last one (often on the right), its output is the output of the whole circuit
=======
top-level? ∨

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

parse trees

--> what are they?

--> draw one for (p ∧ q) → ¬r

--> how do they relate to programming?

--> what is the "top-level operator" here?




--> draw one for p ∨ q ∧ r → ¬p → ¬q ∨ s

implies precede right to left 




--> expression trees

Propositional logic.


- a set of propositional atoms (statements that can be T/F)
    --> these will be our boolean variables in logic statements
    --> must be as simple as possible


- connected by logical operators



- join together to make new propositions (logical sentences)
    that can be true or false


p: I go to class

¬p


////////////////////////////////////////

Which ones are propositions?

Today is Thursday. yes


What time is it? no


x == 2 yes


Pigs can fly. yes


Drive carefully. no


y <= 4 yes



////////////////////////////////////////

Suppose we have these propositional atoms:

    p: It is below freezing.

    q: It is snowing.

    r: y <= 4

    s: x == 2


How would we express these as English sentences?

    ¬p: It is not below freezing


    p ∧ q: It's below freezing and it's snowing


    p → q : If it is below freezing, then it is snowing
        p = F
        q = T
        outputs true

    ¬p → ¬q: If it is not below freezing, then it is not snowing
        p = F
        q = T 
        outputs false
        not equivalent

    r ∨ s: y <= 4 || x == 2

    ¬r: y > 4

- Equivalent propositions
- DeMorgan's laws
- Equivalent if-statements
- Negating if-statements
